# ML: what and why

Machine learning is a set of methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and use the uncovered patterns to predict future data or perform other kinds of decision making under undercertainty.

Long tail property of data: few things are common, most things are rare.

## ML types

* Predictive (supervised) - learn mapping from inputs x to outputs y. Each training input is Usually, inputs are called features, attributes or covariates.
